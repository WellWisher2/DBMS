## Table Creation and insertion of values 

```sql
CREATE TABLE Salesman 
(Salesman_Id INT(4) PRIMARY KEY, 
Name VARCHAR (20), 
City VARCHAR (20), 
Commission VARCHAR (20)); 
INSERT INTO Salesman VALUES (1000, 'John','Bangalore','25 %'); 
CREATE TABLE Customer 
(Customer_Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
Cust_Name VARCHAR (20), 
City VARCHAR (20), 
Grade INTEGER, 
Salesman_Id INT(4), FOREIGN KEY (Salesman_Id) REFERENCES Salesman (Salesman_Id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL); 
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES (10, 'Preethi','Bangalore', 100, 1000); 
CREATE TABLE Orders 
(Ord_No INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
Purchase_Amt INTEGER, 
Ord_Date DATE, 
Customer_Id INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (Customer_Id) REFERENCES Customer 
(Customer_Id) ON DELETE CASCADE, 
Salesman_Id INT(4), FOREIGN KEY (Salesman_Id) REFERENCES Salesman (Salesman_Id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE); 
INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (50, 5000, '2023-05-04', 10, 1000);

1. Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average. 
SELECT COUNT(Customer_Id) AS Customer_Count 
FROM Customer 
WHERE Grade> (SELECT AVG(Grade) 
FROM Customer 
WHERE City='Bangalore');

2. Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer. 
SELECT S.Salesman_ID, S.Name 
FROM Salesman S, Customer C 
WHERE C.Salesman_Id=S.Salesman_Id 
GROUP BY C.Salesman_ID HAVING COUNT(C.Customer_Id)>1;

3. List all salesmen and indicate those who have and don’t have customers in their 
cities (Use UNION operation.) 
SELECT S.Salesman_ID, S.Name, Cust_Name 
FROM Salesman S, Customer C 
WHERE S.City = C.City AND S.Salesman_Id= C.Salesman_Id 
UNION 
SELECT S.Salesman_Id, Name,'No_customer' 
FROM Salesman S 
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
 (SELECT Salesman_id FROM Customer C WHERE S.City = C.City AND S.Salesman_Id= 
C.Salesman_Id);

4. Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of 
a day. 
CREATE VIEW Highest AS SELECT S.Salesman_Id, Name, Ord_Date,Purchase_Amt, 
City FROM Orders B, Salesman S WHERE S.Salesman_Id=B.Salesman_Id AND 
B.Purchase_Amt=(SELECT MAX(E.Purchase_Amt) FROM Orders E WHERE 
B.Ord_Date=E.Ord_Date); 
SELECT * FROM Highest; 
5. Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his 
orders must also be deleted. 
DELETE FROM Salesman 
WHERE Salesman_Id=1000;
```
